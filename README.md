# Challenge - Image search (Unsplash API)

Using the free [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos) service, build a view that allows user to search for images (`GET /search/photos`) and display results in a paginated view.

- Results view that display results in a grid.
- Results must be displayed using pagination / lazy loading.
- Any other features that you think is a **MUST** for great search experience, e.g. "No results found" view, sorting and etc.
